FFXIV Wordpress Character Information
=====================================

Display you Final Fantasy XIV character information on your blog.

This is currently a WIP (work in progress). As of right now, the landscape view has yet to be written. Once completed, there will be two views available to you to choose from.

Portfolio View:

This view is optimal for use in a sidebar. Create a sidebar text widget and place <!-- FFXIV_port --> in the box.

Landscape View:

This view is more for if you want to put a brief synopsis in a short character biography. It will include the same information that is displayed in the portfolio view, just in a landscape format.

Setup:

1. Extract and upload the plugin to your wp-content/plugins folder.

2. Activate the plugin.

3. Goto the FFXIV Config and input your character name, the server, and if you want linkshell information the linkshell ID from XIVPads.com.
